Notes on Unit Tests
===================
*  Be sure to clone the EpoxyDuino project (https://github.com/bxparks/EpoxyDuino) adjacent 
to your SimpleSerialShell project.  This is a dependency for unit testing.  At the moment
there is a dependency on version V1.0.0 of this project.
*  Be sure to clone the AUnit project (https://github.com/bxparks/AUnit) adjacent 
to your SimpleSerialShell project.  This is a dependency for unit testing.

For example:
```
git clone https://github.com/bxparks/EpoxyDuino.git
cd EpoxyDuino
git checkout tags/V1.0.0
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/bxparks/AUnit.git
```
